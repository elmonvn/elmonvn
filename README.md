#### Thanks for visiting my humble profile!

- 👋 Hi, I’m Elmon! I'm a computer scientist and an economist.
- 👀 I’m interested in software development (from system, low-level stuff to scientific programming to web development, and all in-between), data analysis and anything *nix-related. Philology and Phonology as well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the [Julia](https://github.com/topics/julialang) programming language.
- 🏋️ I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of project that can be built on a *nix platform.
